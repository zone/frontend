# Movie listings UI challenge

[![Part of Zone Frontend][zone-fe-image]][zone-fe-url]

> This is not a test! Seriously, try and have fun with it, make it your own!

## Introduction

* 😍 Be sure to write comments and a README. Provide instructions on how to run the project and any notes about your solution.
* 🤩 Feel free to use a JavaScript framework. We use React, Vue and plain JavaScript here but use what you’re most comfortable with.
* 🤨 You can also use a starter kit like [create React app][create-react-app] or [Vue CLI][vue-cli] to save time.
* 🤗 We love clean, responsive interfaces. Pick your favourite [Google font][google-fonts] and layout the movies in a grid, adjusting the number of columns as the device width allows.
* 🤗 We use SCSS here, but use whatever you are most comfortable.
* 🧐 We’re most interested in how you return and layout the results. Also, please don't use a CSS framework.
* 😇 Keep it simple, keep it DRY, but don’t over complicate or over engineer, comment and test as much as possible.
* 🤓 Commit your code to a public Git repository and provide us with the URL.

## Brief

Using the TMDb API display a list of now showing movies allowing the user to filter by genre and rating.

> Note: [You’ll need an TMDb account][tmdb-signup] to request an API key. Once you are registered, go to account settings and click 'API' in sidebar.

## Input

* [TMDb Movies Now Playing API][tmdb-now-playing]
* [TMDb Image API][tmdb-images]
* Minimum rating input with a range between 0 and 10, increments of 0.5 and a default set to 3.

## Output

* Display a list of movies, each showing their title, genres and poster image.
* The movies should be ordered by popularity (most popular first - `popularity` property).
* Movies should also be filterable by their rating (`vote_average` property). i.e If rating was set to 5, you would expect to see all movies with a rating of 5 or higher.
* The input API's should only be called once.
